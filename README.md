Rock Paper Scissors Inspired Game using HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript
This is my first project using JavaScript. It is a game like Rock Paper Scissors where the user chooses a choice between the 3 options. In return, the computer randomly selects its choice. Rules of what rules over each other are in the first slide of the game. The game should go up to a certain number of rounds until it goes to the game over screen.
